# neighbourhoodmap
this project presents my neighbourhood coffees and restaurants.
by using google map API and foursquare API


## google Maps API

1-the Map

2-the markers

3-information window

4-animation for the markers

## foursquare API
i used it to retreve when the coffee/restaurant opens and when it closes


## knockout
And i used the knock out framework that gave me the power of the ' observables ' with the ' data-bind '


###  How to run this app?

Just open index.html in a browser.
